# Code-Analysis-and-Model-Machine-learning
This is a first attempt on analyzing data and making an EDA notebook and making a model machine learning using random tree regressor.

The code is using python in jupyter notebook
The first section of the code is an EDA analysis of the sample code given and the second part of the code is a model machine learning made to determine the outcome of the code using the sample given.
